## Chord Master
An Android app to help you improve your Guitar chord changes

## Description
Take your guitar playing to the next level!

Struggling with pauses in songs when you’re stopping to look at your fingers, or having difficulty placing them down in time? Or putting them down quickly but in the wrong place and sounding...off?

Practicing the chords you find tricky repeatedly and regularly will make your playing smoother, sound better, and more enjoyable.

Chord Master helps you practice and track your progression with your chord changes. Fire up the app, practice a chord change, and input your score. The app will track your progress over time, help you work on your problem changes, and help you master that song you’ve been yearning to play.

What are you waiting for, get strumming with Chord Master!

## Features

* Choose two chords to practice
* Start a countdown timer for you to practice the chord change (count in your head how many you have got!)
* Track the history of all the practice sessions you have had
* Add new chords (the app ships with a default set of base chords)
* Free and Paid flavours (Free contains an interstitial advert after a practice)
* Widget showing your practice history

## How To Use

1. Open the app and you will see the 'Pick' tab. Here you can pick two chords that you want to practice changing between, or press the arrow button for a random change
1. When you selected the chord you want to practice, swipe to the 'Play' tab. Now get your guitar ready, and hit the play button!
1. After a short amount of leadin time (configurable in the settings), the timer will be counting down. Now you should try to do as many chord changes between the two
chords as you can. Go for speed but don't sacrifice accuracy.
1. When the time is up, a notification will sound. A screen will display to input how many chord changes you managed
1. Try another change! The more you practice, the more fluent you will get :)

## Settings
The app ships with many chords already built in. However if you need to add a chord, you can do so on the 'Chords' tab

In the settings menu you can configure:

Countdown Seconds - How long for the main timer
Leadin Seconds - Additional seconds to add onto the main timer so you can get ready before you start

## Persistence
This app makes use of:

* Firebase Database: For persisting your practice history
* SQLite with a Content Provider: For persistent the customisable collection of chords
