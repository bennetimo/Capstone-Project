## Chord Master
An Android app to help you improve your Guitar chord changes

## Description
Take your guitar playing to the next level!

Struggling with pauses in songs when you’re stopping to look at your fingers, or having difficulty placing them down in time? Or putting them down quickly but in the wrong place and sounding...off?

Practicing the chords you find tricky repeatedly and regularly will make your playing smoother, sound better, and more enjoyable.

Chord Master helps you practice and track your progression with your chord changes. Fire up the app, practice a chord change, and input your score. The app will track your progress over time, help you work on your problem changes, and help you master that song you’ve been yearning to play.

What are you waiting for, get strumming with Chord Master!

## Features
